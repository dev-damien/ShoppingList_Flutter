# MinimaList

This Projects is the successor of another university project, which implemented a navive shopping-list app for android.

## What is it?
Its goal is to deliver a very minimalistic approach towards a digital shopping list. No artificial intelligence, recipes, calorie tracking any other distractions.

## And why?
I'm convinced that technology should improve or life by making it more convenient. But I have noticed that applications will try their best to stuff as much functionality into one piece of software as possible. 
But most people are just overwhelmed by the sheer amount of different functions.
So instead of quantity, i dicided to create a shoppinglist app with just t he bare minimum, but with a heavy focus on usability and UX.

## Why Flutter?
The framework of choice for this project is flutter. By using flutter I can maintain one codebase and ensure the quality for all common operating systems.
